## Understanding Technique vs Structure vs Format

As a prompt engineer, inputs for LLMs like Grok include understanding **"prompt technique," "prompt structure,"** and **"prompt format"** — they are related but operate at different levels of abstraction and focus in a well-designed prompt.



## 1. Prompt Technique

**Definition:** This is the high-level method or strategy you employ to elicit the desired response from an LLM. It's about leveraging psychological or logical patterns that models have learned from training data to improve output quality, reduce hallucinations, or handle complex tasks.

**Key Focus:** Why you’re prompting in a certain way and what cognitive process you’re simulating.

**When to Use:** For solving specific problems like reasoning, creativity, or bias mitigation.

**Examples:**
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** "Solve this math problem step by step: What is 15% of 200?"
- **Few-Shot Prompting:** "Translate these: 'Hello' → 'Bonjour'. 'Goodbye' → 'Au revoir'. Now: 'Thank you' →"
- **Role-Playing:** "You are a pirate captain. Describe finding treasure."

**Prompt Engineer Tip:** Techniques are iterative—test them with A/B variations to measure response accuracy or coherence. They're the "art" side of prompting, often requiring experimentation.

## 2. Prompt Structure

**Definition:** This refers to the overall organisation and logical flow of the prompt's content. It's like the skeleton that holds everything together, ensuring the model processes information in a sequence that makes sense.

**Key Focus:** Hierarchy and sequencing of elements.

**When to Use:**  Helps manage complexity, especially in multi-step tasks or long prompts, by breaking them into digestible parts.

**Examples:**
- Basic: `[Instructions] + [Context] + [Query]`
- Advanced: Sections like "Task", "Constraints", "Examples", "Input"

**Prompt Engineer Tip:** Good structure minimises token waste and improves consistency. Always start with clear instructions to "prime" the model, and end with a direct call-to-action to focus the output.


---

## 3. Prompt Format

**Definition:** The stylistic and syntactic presentation of the prompt that makes it easier for the model to parse and respond.

**Key Focus:** Readability and machine-friendliness.

**When to Use:** To enforce output styles or structured data.

**Examples:**
- Triple quotes or XML tags
- Markdown for bold and bullets
- JSON/YAML for structured responses

**Prompt Engineer Tip:** Avoid over-formatting — it can make prompts brittle.
